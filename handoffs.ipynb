Understanding loops will help you handle tasks that require repetition efficiently.\\n\\n## 1. The `for` Loop\\n\\n### Syntax\\n\\nThe `for` loop is used for iterating over a range. It consists of three parts:\\n\\n- Initialization\\n- Condition\\n- Update\\n\\n```java\\nfor(initialization; condition; update) {\\n    // Code to be executed\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Counting from 1 to 5\\n\\n```java\\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\\n    System.out.println(i);\\n}\\n// This will print numbers 1 to 5\\n```\\n\\n## 2. The `while` Loop\\n\\n### Syntax\\n\\nThe `while` loop executes a block of code as long as the condition is true.\\n\\n```java\\nwhile(condition) {\\n    // Code to be executed\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Countdown from 5\\n\\n```java\\nint count = 5;\\nwhile(count > 0) {\\n    System.out.println(count);\\n    count--;\\n}\\n// This will print numbers 5 to 1\\n```\\n\\n## 3. The `do-while` Loop\\n\\n### Syntax\\n\\nThe `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it checks the condition after executing the block of code. This guarantees that the code will run at least once.\\n\\n```java\\ndo {\\n    // Code to be executed\\n} while(condition);\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Print numbers until reaching 5\\n\\n```java\\nint number = 1;\\ndo {\\n    System.out.println(number);\\n    number++;\\n} while(number <= 5);\\n// This will print numbers 1 to 5\\n```\\n\\n## 4. Enhanced `for` Loop (for-each)\\n\\n### Syntax\\n\\nThe enhanced `for` loop is used for iterating over arrays or collections.\\n\\n```java\\nfor(type element : array) {\\n    // Code to be executed\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Iterating over an array\\n\\n```java\\nint[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nfor(int number : numbers) {\\n    System.out.println(number);\\n}\\n// This will print each number in the array\\n```\\n\\n## 5. Nested Loops\\n\\nNested loops are loops inside another loop.\\n\\n### Example: Multiplication table\\n\\n```java\\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\\n    for(int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {\\n        System.out.print(i * j + \" \");\\n    }\\n    System.out.println();\\n}\\n// This will print a 5x5 multiplication table\\n```\\n\\n## 6. Best Practices\\n\\n### Avoiding Infinite Loops\\n\\nAlways ensure that the loop has a condition that can terminate. Infinite loops can crash your program.\\n\\n### Loop Control Statements\\n\\nUse `break` and `continue` to control loop execution.\\n\\n- `break` will exit the loop.\\n- `continue` will skip the current iteration.\\n\\n```java\\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\\n    if(i == 5) {\\n        continue; // Skip the number 5\\n    }\\n    System.out.println(i);\\n}\\n\\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\\n    if(i == 7) {\\n        break; // Stop the loop when 7 is reached\\n    }\\n    System.out.println(i);\\n}\\n```\\n'\n"

This invasion prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany two days later, on September 3, 1939.\\n\\n### Context Leading to the War:\\n\\n1. **Treaty of Versailles (1919):** After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles placed heavy reparations and territorial losses on Germany. This caused economic hardship and resentment among Germans.\\n\\n2. **Rise of Fascism:** During the 1920s and 1930s, fascist regimes emerged in several countries. Hitler\\'s rise to power in Germany in 1933 was a significant turning point, as he sought to overturn the post-World War I order and expand German territory.\\n\\n3. **Expansion and Appeasement:**\\n   - **Reoccupation of the Rhineland (1936):** Germany reoccupied this demilitarized zone, violating the Treaty of Versailles.\\n   - **Annexation of Austria (1938):** Known as the Anschluss, Austria was annexed into Germany.\\n   - **Munich Agreement (1938):** Britain and France allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia, in hopes of preventing further aggression.\\n\\n4. **Non-Aggression Pact (1939):** Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, pledging not to attack each other. Secretly, they agreed to divide Eastern Europe between them.\\n\\n### Immediate Cause:\\n\\n- **Invasion of Poland:** Germany\\'s attack on Poland was swift, using a strategy known as \"Blitzkrieg\" or lightning war, characterized by fast-moving, coordinated strikes using aircraft, tanks, and troops. The Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east on September 17, 1939, effectively dividing the country.\\n\\nThese actions set off a series of events that escalated into a global conflict involving many nations, eventually drawing in countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, and lasting until 1945.'"
